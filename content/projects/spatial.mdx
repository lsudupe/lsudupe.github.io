title: "Spatial Transcriptomics Unveils Novel Potential Mechanisms of Disease in a MI cγ1 Multiple Myeloma in vivo Model"
description: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell (PC) disorder characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of PCs in the bone marrow (BM) where the interactions between the PCs and the BM microenvironment guide the pathogenesis of the disease. The development of single cell technologies has contributed to understand the transcriptional heterogeneity of the disease both from the tumor and the microenvironment point of view, yet the spatial organization of cellular states and niche-specific regulatory programs remain to be investigated.

## Description

Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell (PC) disorder characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of PCs in the bone marrow (BM) where the interactions between the PCs and the BM microenvironment guide the pathogenesis of the disease. The development of single cell technologies has contributed to understand the transcriptional heterogeneity of the disease both from the tumor and the microenvironment point of view, yet the spatial organization of cellular states and niche-specific regulatory programs remain to be investigated.

#### Description

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), reside in a specialized bone marrow (BM) microenvironment known as the hematopoietic stem niche. Despite the critical role of the niche in tightly controlling the processes of normal and malignant hematopoiesis, its cellular composition remains only partially understood. Recent studies, including our own, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches have provided valuable insights into the profiling of the human BM niche. However, a comprehensive effort to describe the cellular heterogeneity and regulatory circuitry of the aged BM microenvironment in elderly humans is still lacking. As individual age, multiple systems and organs experience a progressive loss of anatomical and physiological integrity. Aging of the HSC niche is accompanied by a reduction in the numbers and function of its constituents and a decrease in the levels of HSC-supporting factors …
