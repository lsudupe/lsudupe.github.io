Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), reside in a specialized bone marrow (BM) microenvironment known as the hematopoietic stem niche. Despite the critical role of the niche in tightly controlling the processes of normal and malignant hematopoiesis, its cellular composition remains only partially understood. Recent studies, including our own, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches have provided valuable insights into the profiling of the human BM niche.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), reside in a specialized bone marrow (BM) microenvironment known as the hematopoietic stem niche. Despite the critical role of the niche in tightly controlling the processes of normal and malignant hematopoiesis, its cellular composition remains only partially understood. Recent studies, including our own, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches have provided valuable insights into the profiling of the human BM niche.
